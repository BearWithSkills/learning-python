The first two chapters go over the raw basics of strings, f-strings, setting variables, and funfacts about python.
I'll spare anyone reading this by skipping to chapter three, where I learned functions.

1.) First function:
def area_of_circle(radius):
    pi = 3.14
    area = pi * radius * radius
    return area
  
  
sword_length = 1.0
spear_length = 2.0

2.) Multiple parameters:
def triple_attack(damage_one, damage_two, damage_three):
    total = damage_one + damage_two + damage_three
    return total

3.) Printing vs returning:
def get_title(first_name, last_name, job):
    title = first_name + " " + last_name + " the " + job
    print(title)

4.) Were to declare functions:
main()
def main():
    print("Fantasy Quest is booting up...")
    print("Game is running!")

5.) A little more practice:
5.1) 
def to_celsius(f):
    degrees_c = 5 / 9 * (f - 32)
    return degrees_c
5.2) 
def hours_to_seconds(hours):
    return hours * 60 * 60

6.) Multiple return values:
def become_warrior(first_name, last_name, power):
    title = f"{first_name} {last_name} the warrior"
    new_power = power + 1
    return title, new_power

7.) Two end of module challenges:
def curse(weapon_damage):
    lesser_cursed = weapon_damage * 0.5
    greater_cursed = weapon_damage * 0.25
    return lesser_cursed, greater_cursed

def enchant_and_attack(target_health, damage, weapon):
    enchanted_damage = damage + 10
    new_health = target_health - enchanted_damage
    enchanted_weapon = "enchanted " + weapon
    return enchanted_weapon, new_health
